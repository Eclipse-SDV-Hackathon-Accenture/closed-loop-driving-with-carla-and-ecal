# Closed loop driving with CARLA and eCAL üöó

This is a **creativity challenge**. We provide you with the CARLA Simulator and some interface code to Eclipse eCAL. Your task is to **create something cool** with it.

- You can use any programming language you want.
- You can use any sensor data you want.
- You can use any algorithm you want.
- You can use any hardware you want.
- You can use any software you want.
- You can use any library you want.
- You can use any framework you want.
- You can use any cloud service you want.
- You can use any machine learning model you want.
- You can use any data you want.

# üìö About

[Eclipse eCAL‚Ñ¢](http://ecal.io) is a **publish subscribe** Middleware with the main focus on research and development of **autonomous driving** algorithms.

- A Publisher **publishes data** to a topic, identified by a name.
- A Subscriber **subscribes to a topic**, identified by a name. When it received data, it calls a **callback function**.

[CARLA](https://carla.org/) is an open-source **simulator for autonomous driving** research. It provides a realistic environment for testing and developing autonomous driving algorithms.

- It provides a variety of sensors and weather conditions to simulate **real-world scenarios**.
- It also supports different types of **vehicles and pedestrians**.
- We provide you with a **bridge** between CARLA and eCAL.

# üëæ Hack Ideas

- Detect pedestrians from the camera image and **track them**.
- Steer the vehicle to **follow a lane**.
- Use the Google gesture recognition model to **control the vehicle**.


# üíª Requirements

- A rather **powerful GPU** is required to run CARLA
- **Programming languages**
    - Recommended: Python or C++
    - Other options: C, C#, JavaScript, Rust

*We recommend using Windows or Ubuntu. MacOS may work too, but eCAL is poorly tested on that OS.*
